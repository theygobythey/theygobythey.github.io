				<p><strong>Jaq Nguyen Victor</strong> is the whimsy-drenched child of a Vietnamese love-warrior mother to whom they credit any and all magical abilities. Such magic includes: qtpoc stand-up comedy with Peacock Rebellion’s Brouhaha crew at the National Queer Arts Festival, theatrical clowning at the Clown School of San Francisco, qtpoc facilitation with Blackgirl Dangerous, and teaching youth with the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network (DVAN). Their full-length show, Gender Assimilation: A Rebuttal, recently debuted at 17th Annual United States of Asian America Festival. They also recently performed at Stories of Queer Diaspora 2014. Jaq is currently pursuing their graduate studies in Drama Therapy at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy from the University of Colorado at Boulder. The majority of their work centers on expanding the scope of politically viable and loveable selfhoods, starting with their own. They can usually be found shit talking oppression, ogling hypoallergenic doggies, and galloping around the Bay to advocate for sacred liberatory play as a tenderqueer unicorn.

					<p><strong>Gender Assimilation: A Rebuttal</strong> What is it to be genderqueer? In an intimate portrayal, Jaq Victor gives themself over to theatrical investigation in a debut solo show. Their butt serves as staging ground upon which to expose and push back against social narratives around racism, beauty privilege, transphobia, horizontal oppression, and so much more.</p>

					<p>A cheeky coming out tale about identity politics and butts. Written and performed by Jaq Victor. Directed by Lilia Leshan.</p>
