				<p><strong>Jaq Nguyen Victor</strong> is the whimsy-drenched child of a love-warrior mother to whom they credit any and all of their magic. They go by they. This queer, genderqueer, Vietnamese-American unicorn with an invisible disability is finishing up their graduate studies in Drama Therapy at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) and holds a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder). They are also a massage therapist. Jaq adores galloping around the Bay Area doing things like: social justice stand up comedy with Peacock Rebellion, teaching art with the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network (DVAN), theatrical clowning with the Clown School of San Francisco, facilitating with Blackgirl Dangerous, presenting at the Queer Asian Conference (QACON), hosting Vietnamese language dinners with Bữa Ăn Tiếng Việt (BATV), mentoring at the Gender Spectrum Conference, supporting students of color with POC Thrive, eco-justice healing with the Work that Reconnects (WTR), being a camp counseling at Queer Camp, em-ceeing with the Asian Pacific Islander Queer Women & Trans Community (APIQWTC), training in non-violent direct action with the Buddhist Peace Fellowship (BPF), and more. Last year, they debuted their first full-length show, <i>Gender Assimilation: A Rebuttal</i>, at the United States of Asian America Festival (USAAF). This year, Jaq will premiere their first short film, <i>Swanicorn: A Genderqueer Fairytale</i>, at the Queer Women of Color Media Arts Project Film Festival (QWOCMAP). They will also do a theatrical clown performance, <i>Decolonization is Like Hard: A Clown's 12 Step Journey</i>, at Stanford’s Soul Wound Conference. Currently, Jaq is working on two plays, <i>Princess Genderqueer & the Racist Pea</i> and <i>The Unicorn Genome Project</i> and also completing a short film, <i>Drugs for Unicorns</i>. Soon, they will be directing a theater troupe called QD Play: Queering & Decolonizing Playback, an artists training called Dig & Demand: Diasporic Vietnamese Artists for Justice, and a community gathering of Vietnamese trans* friends called Chanh Collective.

					<p><strong>Gender Assimilation: A Rebuttal</strong> What is it to be genderqueer? In an intimate portrayal, Jaq Victor gives themself over to theatrical investigation in a debut solo show. Their butt serves as staging ground upon which to expose and push back against social narratives around racism, beauty privilege, transphobia, horizontal oppression, and so much more.</p>

					<p>A cheeky coming out tale about identity politics and butts. Written and performed by Jaq Victor. Directed by Lilia Leshan.</p>
