				<p><strong>Jaq Nguyen Victor</strong> is the whimsy-drenched child of a love-warrior mother to whom they credit all of their magic. This queer, genderqueer, Vietnamese unicorn is finishing up their graduate studies in Drama Therapy at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) and holds a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder). They are also a massage therapist with an invisible disability. Jaq adores galloping around the Bay area doing things like: social justice stand up comedy with Peacock Rebellion, teaching art with the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network (DVAN), youth programming with Blackgirl Dangerous, em-ceeing with the Asian Pacific Islander Queer Women & Trans Community (APIQWTC), mentoring at the Gender Spectrum Conference, facilitating workshops at the Queer Asian Conference (QZCON), eco-justice healing with the Work that Reconnects (WTR), non-violent direct action with the Buddhist Peace Fellowship (BPF), and more. This year, Jaq will premiere their first short film, <i>Swanicorn: A Genderqueer Fairytale</i>, at the Queer Women of Color Media Arts Project Film Festival (QWOCMAP) and a short performance piece called <i>Decolonization is Like Hard</i> at Stanfordâ€™s Soul Wound Conference. Last year, they debuted their first full-length show, <i>Gender Assimilation: A Rebuttal</i>, at the United States of Asian America Festival (USAAF). Currently, Jaq is working on two plays, <i>Princess Genderqueer & the Racist Pea</i> and <i>The Unicorn Genome Project</i>. Soon, they will be directing a troupe called QD Play: Queering & Decolonizing Playback and a training called Dig & Demand: Diasporic Vietnamese Artists for Justice.

					<p><strong>Gender Assimilation: A Rebuttal</strong> What is it to be genderqueer? In an intimate portrayal, Jaq Victor gives themself over to theatrical investigation in a debut solo show. Their butt serves as staging ground upon which to expose and push back against social narratives around racism, beauty privilege, transphobia, horizontal oppression, and so much more.</p>

					<p>A cheeky coming out tale about identity politics and butts. Written and performed by Jaq Victor. Directed by Lilia Leshan.</p>
