				<p><strong>Jaq Nguyen Victor</strong> is the whimsy-drenched, second-generation child of a Vietnamese love warrior mother to whom they credit any and all magical gifts. They go by they. This genderqueer unicorn is pursuing graduate studies in Drama Therapy at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) and holds a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from the University of Colorado (CU Boulder). Last year, Jaq debuted a full-length show, Gender Assimilation: A Rebuttal, at the United States of Asian America Festival (USAAF) and is currently working on two others, Decolonization is Like Hard and Princess Genderqueer & the Racist Pea. This year, they will be debuting a short film, Swanicorn: A Genderqueer Fairytale, at the Queer Women of Color Media Arts Project Film Festival (QWOCMAP) and are currently completing another, Drugs for Unicorns. Other work includes: social justice stand-up comedy with Peacock Rebellionâ€™s Brouhaha troupe, theatrical clowning with the Clown School of San Francisco, youth programming with Blackgirl Dangerous, eco-justice training with the Work that Reconnects, and nonviolent direct action with the Buddhist Peace Fellowship. They will soon be directing an independent playback theater troupe called QD Play: Queering & Decolonizing Playback and facilitating a training called Dig & Demand: Diasporic Vietnamese Artists for Justice with the Diasporic Vietnamese Artist Network (DVAN).

					<p><strong>Gender Assimilation: A Rebuttal</strong> What is it to be genderqueer? In an intimate portrayal, Jaq Victor gives themself over to theatrical investigation in a debut solo show. Their butt serves as staging ground upon which to expose and push back against social narratives around racism, beauty privilege, transphobia, horizontal oppression, and so much more.</p>

					<p>A cheeky coming out tale about identity politics and butts. Written and performed by Jaq Victor. Directed by Lilia Leshan.</p>
